# HealthCare Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to provide insights into hospital performance, costs, and patient outcomes. The analysis is performed using Excel, Power Query Editor, and Power BI, offering detailed visualizations and data handling.

## Outcomes

### Hospital Performance

- **Top Hospitals by Average LOS (Length of Stay):**
  - Kings County Hospital: 12.0 days
  - Interfaith Medical Center: 9.3 days
  - Memorial Hospital for Cancer: 9.1 days

- **Bottom Hospitals by Average LOS:**
  - Alice Hyde Medical Center: 1.7 days
  - St Elizabeth Medical Center: 1.6 days
  - Northern Dutchess Hospital: 1.4 days

### Cost Analysis

- **Highest Average Cost per Discharge:**
  - NYU Lutheran Medical Center: $85K
  - Olean General Hospital: $81K
  - Memorial Hospital for Cancer: $64K

- **Lowest Average Cost per Discharge:**
  - United Memorial Medical Center: $8.9K
  - St. Mary's Healthcare: $8.5K
  - Newark-Wayne Community Hospital: $7.7K

### Influencers on LOS and Cost

- Factors influencing the Average LOS include severity of illness, risk of mortality, and patient disposition.
- Factors influencing the Average Cost per Discharge include the health service area and specific conditions.

## Tools Used

- **Excel:** For initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- **Power Query Editor:** To handle missing values and transform data as per specific criteria.
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key insights.
